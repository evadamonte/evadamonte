## Tidy Data Project 🫧🛀🏼🧼 : 
- Project Overview: In my tidy data project, there is a transforming of a dataset. I am using the 2008 Olumpic medalist data set which has many missing values and is untidy. In my project, I reshaped the data from a wide to long format, as well as create seperate columsnb for the main variables in the data set which are gender, sports, as well as the metal recieved. After all of the data cleaning, I was able to create a clear and concise dataset that is easy to underatand. I also created multiple visulizations so that you can clearly see the data and its conenctions!

## 💖 What I Add
1. **Professional Bio**:
I am a junior at the University of Notre Dame studing finance with a minor in computer digital technology and theology. I am an interested student who enjoys real life application and hands on learning. I am from Reno, Nevada (the biggest little city in the world) and I love the outdoors. Catch me skiing both in the mountains and on Lake Tahoe! I enjoy making data come to life and engaging in the visualization process of code. I enjoy taking data that is appealing and summarizing it in a way that is easy for others to stand as well as is accurate as possible. I look forward to creating fun and engaging projects this semester as I continue to grow and expand my skils in python and vs code. 
   
2. **Technical Skills**:
   - Python
   - R
   - Leadership
   - Teamwork
   - FUN!
3. **Projects**:
